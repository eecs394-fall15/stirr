    {"step": "Boil water, 1 teaspoon of salt and oil in a large sauce pan or dutch oven. Gradually add shells when water is at a rapid boil. Boil for 1 minute less than package directions for al dente. Shells will continue to cook when placed in the oven. To avoid mushy pasta, you want to initially under-cook."},
    {"step": "Remove and drain on a paper towel lined baking sheet. Dampen 2 paper towels and place them on top of shells to keep them moist. Set aside."},
    {"step": "Melt butter in medium saucepan. Add chopped onion and mushrooms. Saute for 5 minutes. Remove mushroom mixture and set aside."},
    {"step": "In the same saucepan add flour and whisk into the remaining butter to make a roux (paste). Blend until smooth and bubbly. Whisk in milk, half and half, white pepper and salt. Simmer for an additional 5 minutes, whisking occasionally."},
    {"step": "Ladle the remaining sauce over stuffed shells. Top with Parmesan cheese."}
